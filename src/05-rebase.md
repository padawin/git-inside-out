## Rebase

### Introduction

This chapter will be longer than the previous ones, and split in multiple parts.
We will answer the following questions:

- What does the `rebase` command **mean**?
- What does the `rebase` command **do**?
- How to verify that a rebase went well?
- If a rebase did not go well, how to fix it?

My goal through these will be to demystify this command, help people
understand that in itself, it is a safe and very useful command to use.

We will also see when a rebase should be used, and when it should not.

In this chapter, we will also discover the interactive rebase, how to use it,
and I will answer when do I recommend using a "normal" rebase and when do I
recommend using an "interactive" one.

**Like the previous chapters, this one will only talk about a command in itself,
as a tool. This chapter will not cover workflows using rebase.**
